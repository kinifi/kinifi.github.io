Company Loyalty
==================

When you get a job for a company there are a few things to remember that a lot of people forget. Myself included has fallen victim to this so don't feel like I'm innocent here.

Company Culture

Companies love to use the word "culture" when describing what its like to work at their company. The company you work for needs you to be happy. They need you to feel like you are part of the company and the projects you work on. This makes the product better because you as an employee of said company now are passionate about something the company is selling. 

Its very important to remember that no matter how talented you are, no matter what position you have, and no matter how much you are being paid. You are a number to this company. You have an employee number, you were hired to get a specific job done, and that is what you are to this company. Nothing more, and nothing less. The people you work with is what makes your position and the company you work for MORE than a company number. 

This is important. The company is allowing for you and your coworkers to make a fun and productive environment because your company number must bring value to the company sales.

The Company Will Never Choose You Over What Benefits The Company

When push comes to shove, the company needs revenue. They are a business. If they made decisions all the time that didn't benefit the business, you and your coworkers wouldn't have the salary you have, or may not be hired at all. 

This is a business and a business needs money.

So Why Enjoy Working For A Company If The Company Doesn't Really Care About You?

1. Take pride in your work. 
2. Know that this company may feel like family sometimes but that is an illusion. The coworkers you see and work with make it your family. They will be there for you when the company goes away, or if you switch jobs. Your coworkers are what feel like family and you happen to be working for said company. This doesn't not make the company family. 
3. If you worried about finding a company that cares about you and wouldn't lay you off when times got hard, let you work from home when your kid was sick, or let you move to another location, then you would probably never work anywhere. 
4. Just know you are working for a business and they will make decisions for the business which could impact you in a negative way. Knowing and Remembering is half of the battle.

Are There Companies Out There That Won't Treat Me Like A Number? 

Yes, but they quickly hide your number through HR and invite you to work outtings to get to know your coworkers, have parties, and travel places. You are always a number and thats okay!

I Want To Work For A Company That Will Treat Me And My Family How I Would My Family!

This is hard because its a business. Why should they care about your family? They just need you to get the work done. This doesn't mean a company wouldn't work with you to make things easier but they will always want you to get the work done because they are paying you to do it or they will just find someone else.

You Are Replacable

Never forget this subtitle. Just enjoy that you are making money, have pride in your work and dont make work "your family", make friends with your coworkers because they will be there for you when you leave.

Conclusion

It is okay that you are a number to your employer. It is okay if you are tricked into joining the culture. It is okay. Just do your job, leave work and go get drinks with friends, eat dinner with your family, and enjoy life. This job isn't forever.
