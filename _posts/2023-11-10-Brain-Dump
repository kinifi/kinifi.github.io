Brain Dump
==================

Professionally a lot has happened. We successfully announced the Vision Pro which is a huge achievement and something so big I never thought I would accomplish. I moved across the country to be part of this project, my child is only 6 months older then the project itself, got a divorce, was homeless, and started life all over again with my daughter. 

Its been crazy but I'm excited to share some of the technical thoughts I've been having on the current environment of iOS/MacOS/and Vision OS development
